#💻 About Me
<br><br>
Hi there! 👋 I'm Vikas, a passionate front-end developer and aspiring full-stack engineer. My journey into the tech world began with curiosity and a dream to build impactful solutions. Over time, I’ve acquired a strong foundation in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React, alongside a growing expertise in data structures and algorithms (DSA).

What drives me is the process of solving problems, building projects, and constantly learning. From creating intuitive user interfaces to understanding the intricacies of binary search trees and Dijkstra's algorithm, I love the challenge of turning ideas into reality.

🚀 What I’ve Learned So Far
Front-End Development
Built responsive websites and clones of platforms like Myntra and YouTube using HTML5, CSS3, and Tailwind CSS.
Completed interactive projects like an e-commerce site and a rock-paper-scissors game.
Gained proficiency in React through the Namaste React course.

Back-End Exploration
Starting to explore backend development with Go, aiming to create robust APIs.

DSA Mastery
Studied linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs in depth through Colt Steele’s DSA course.
Solved problems using binary heaps, BFS, DFS, and Dijkstra’s Algorithm.
Practicing competitive programming on platforms like LeetCode and Codeforces.

🌱 What’s Next?
I’m currently working on:

Completing full-stack projects to enhance my portfolio.
Deep-diving into blockchain technology and Go programming.
Preparing for competitive programming challenges and aiming to excel at CP on Codeforces.

✨ Fun Fact
I believe in the journey more than the destination. Every project, every solved algorithm problem, and every "aha" moment counts as a win. My mantra? 🌟 "Build your garden, and the butterflies will come!"
